# Calculating the adiabaticity using object oriented programming
 
This code demonstraes object oriented programming concepts in the context of loading data and clculating the adiabaticity of a binary black hole system using both post-Newtonian and graviational self-force theory.

The first and second-order flux data for the a=0 case are from: Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 151102
